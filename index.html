        <p>Because of extreme weather, we're only going to meet f2f for <strong> one day</strong> in the entire first two weeks of class.</p>
        <p>The use of <strong>emphasis</strong> (the em tag) is usually to signal a change in meaning through a change in emphasis. Consider the difference between the identical sentence, with different emphasis (emphasis on "I" in the first, and on "last" in the second):</p>
        <p><em>I</em> didn't steal the last cookie.</p>
        <p>I didn't steal the <em>last</em> cookie.</p>
        <p>Viburnums are a versatile landscape shrub with a certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em> that appeals to me. There are even some viburnums on the UWM campus. To quote Wikipedia about the name Viburnum, <q>The generic name originated in Latin, where it referred to <em>V. lantana.</em></q></p>
        <p>One of the textbooks for this class is <em>Don't Make Me Think Revisited</em> by Steve Krug, who says of usability, <q>It's not rocket surgery.</q></p>
        <p>H<sub>2</sub>O is the chemical formula for water. The area of a circle is pi r<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <p><strong>Vegetables aren't healthy, tasty, fun or even very colourful any more, kids.</strong> No. They're evil - and they're coming to get you! So says an advert on ITV and backed by the UK's leading supermarkets and Birds Eye, with endorsements from Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Jamie Oliver.</P>
        <p>Notice how in the paragraph above, the bold text in the screen shot draws the eye and helps you find the beginning of the text? This is a common print convention in magazines or newspapers (digital and analog), which helps the sighted viewer find the beginning of a story on a page that has a lot of other information on it (other stories, advertisements, etc). The tag that creates this visual pathway is <strong>non-semantic</strong> because the bold text doesn't meaning anything special; it is just at the beginning, so the visual formatting grabs the eye.</p>
    
    <h2> BLOCK TAGS</h2>
            <p>Use the different grouping elements to mark up the text appropriately. The text itself should suggest the element needed, but use the screen shot for guidance. As you read the text, consider its role and its content. The text itself will seem a little random, because you need opportunities to use lots of different tags. There is a link to the cricket story. The lecture notes will help you understand the two places you will use this.</p>
            <p>Here is an interesting story about a popular sport outside of the United States: cricket.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>A gutsy Beth Mooney has guided the Brisbane Heat to a three-wicket upset of the Sydney Sixers to claim their maiden <abbr title ="Women's Big Bash Leauge">WBBL</abbr> title at Drummoyne Oval. Laura Harris hit the winnings runs with four balls remaining when she smashed a four between Erin Burns and Sara McGlashan.</p>
                <p>After being set 132 for victory and needing five off the final over, Harris and Delissa Kimmince guided the underdogs over the line against the two-time reigning champions. However Mooney was the hero, defying illness to hit a match-winning 65 off 46 balls in front of a sold out crowd of 5,368-and several hundred more watching from vantage points outside the suburban ground in Sydney's inner west.</p>
                <p>After being outstanding behind the stumps during the Sixers' knock - taking two catches including a ripper to dismiss Erin Burns - Mooney was visibly struggling in the stifling heat. The Brisbane trainers on several occasions ran out drinks to the left-hander and she was frequently down on her haunches.</p>
